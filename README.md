# Alexa-bmcc-demo1
In way to use this project, do not forget to install node and have all 
the modules required (aws-sdk and alexa-sdk) inside the same path folder.
Once in the folder, upload it to your Lambda function as a .zip file
For mac users you must .zip the folder from the terminal, do not compress.
The command for zipping files will be : zip -r ../nameoffile.zip *

Have fun!
